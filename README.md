GamerUSB is a large library of games designed to be put on to a USB Drive.
This is intended to be used with Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 with 64 bit architecture.

Minimum system requirements:
Architecture: at least 64 Bit.
USB Storage: at least 4GB of storage space, to make room for more storage demanding games later on.
RAM: at least 2GB.
OS: Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 with 64 bit architecture.
Sorry, but I don't have the time to upload games due to my exams on Dec 17-18, 2024
